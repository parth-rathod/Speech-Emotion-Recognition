# Speech-Emotion-Recognition

### Abstract
1) In the past decade a lot of research has gone into Automatic Speech Emotion Recognition (SER). The primary objective of SER is to improve man-machine interface. It can also be used to monitor psycho physiological state of a person in lie detectors. In recent time speech emotion recognition also has applications in medicine and forensics.
2) The task of speech emotion recognition is very challenging for following reasons. First it is not clear which speech features are powerful in distinguishing between emotions. Second issue is that how a certain emotion is expressed generally depends on the speaker, his or her culture and environment. Most of the work has focused on monolingual emotion classification making an assumption there is no cultural difference among speakers. This project aims to capture the correct prediction of speech emotions by using Machine Learning techniques.
